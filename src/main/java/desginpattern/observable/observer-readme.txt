CP a Mobile lover always looks for New Arrival Mobile in Amazon Marketplace.
His problem is he cant have continuous eye on website fir new Arrival.
What he did is subscribed for new Arrival in Amazon Marketplace. 
So that whenever new Mobile is launched for Sale CP will be notified.

There are many New Arrival Enthusiast who wants to buy product when they just arrived however they dont have time to continuously watch
the Amazon site.

What if as soon as any Mobile is Launched Amaozn notifies all the subscriber ?

This scenario becomes a good candidate for Publisher - Subscriber Model and a typical case of Observer Pattern.
